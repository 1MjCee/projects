Project Proposal: SurveyPay Platform
Overview
SurveyPay is a web application designed to connect users with paid surveys. Users sign up, complete surveys composed of multiple questions, and earn $1 per question answered. The app will feature a Next.js frontend (using the latest App Router) for a modern, fast user experience and a Django backend for secure user management, survey creation, and payment processing. The project will be organized into two main folders: frontend (Next.js) and backend (Django).

Objectives
Provide an intuitive platform for users to browse and complete surveys.

Ensure secure user authentication and payment tracking.

Allow administrators to create and manage surveys.

Pay users based on the number of questions they answer ($1 per question).

Maintain a clean, modular codebase for scalability.

Tech Stack
Frontend: Next.js (using App Router) - for dynamic, server-rendered pages and a great user experience.

Backend: Django (Python framework) - for robust API development, database management, and authentication.

Database: PostgreSQL - reliable and scalable, integrates well with Django.

Payment Integration: Stripe - for secure and straightforward payouts to users.

Styling: Tailwind CSS - for rapid, responsive design.

Deployment: Vercel (frontend), Heroku/DigitalOcean (backend) - easy and scalable hosting.

Detailed Description
Features
User Authentication

Users can sign up, log in, and log out.

Profile page to view earnings and completed surveys.

Survey System

Surveys consist of multiple questions (e.g., multiple-choice, text input).

Users can browse available surveys and select one to complete.

Progress is saved, and users earn $1 per question upon completion.

Payment System

Earnings are tracked in the user’s account ($1 per question).

Users can request payouts via Stripe once they reach a minimum threshold (e.g., $10).

Admin Dashboard

Admins can create, edit, and delete surveys.

View user activity and payout requests.

Responsive Design

Mobile-friendly interface for accessibility on all devices.

Frontend (Next.js with App Router)
The frontend will handle the user interface and communicate with the backend via RESTful APIs. Using the App Router allows for better organization and server-side rendering.

Key Pages:
/: Home page with a list of available surveys.

/survey/[id]: Dynamic page to complete a specific survey.

/dashboard: User dashboard showing earnings and history.

/(auth)/login and /(auth)/signup: Authentication pages.

Components:
SurveyCard: Displays survey title, number of questions, and potential earnings.

Question: Renders individual survey questions with input options.

Navbar: Navigation bar with links to home, profile, and logout.

API Calls:
Fetch surveys: GET /api/surveys/

Submit answers: POST /api/surveys/[id]/submit

Get user data: GET /api/user/profile

Request payout: POST /api/payments/request

Backend (Django)
The backend will manage data, business logic, and integrations.

Apps:
users: Handles authentication and user profiles.

Models: User (extends Django’s AbstractUser), Profile (earnings, payment info).

surveys: Manages survey creation and submissions.

Models: Survey, Question, Answer.

payments: Tracks earnings and processes payouts.

Models: Transaction.

API Endpoints:
GET /api/surveys/: List all available surveys.

GET /api/surveys/[id]: Get details of a specific survey.

POST /api/surveys/[id]/submit: Submit answers and calculate earnings.

POST /api/payments/request: Initiate a payout via Stripe.

Payment Logic:
When a user submits a survey, calculate earnings (# questions × $1).

Store earnings in the Profile model.

Use Stripe API to process payouts when requested.

Database Schema (PostgreSQL)
User:

id, username, email, password, created_at, updated_at.

Profile:

id, user_id (ForeignKey to User), earnings, stripe_customer_id.

Survey:

id, title, description, created_by (ForeignKey to User), created_at.

Question:

id, survey_id (ForeignKey to Survey), text, type (e.g., multiple-choice, text).

Answer:

id, question_id (ForeignKey to Question), user_id (ForeignKey to User), response.

Transaction:

id, user_id (ForeignKey to User), amount, status, created_at.

Implementation Steps
Set Up Next.js Frontend:

Initialize a Next.js project with the App Router.

Set up Tailwind CSS for styling.

Create reusable components (e.g., SurveyCard, Question).

Implement API calls to the Django backend.

Set Up Django Backend:

Initialize a Django project and create apps for users, surveys, and payments.

Set up PostgreSQL and configure Django to use it.

Implement RESTful APIs using Django REST Framework.

Integrate Stripe:

Set up Stripe for payment processing.

Implement payout logic in the payments app.

Deploy:

Deploy the Next.js frontend on Vercel.

Deploy the Django backend on Heroku or DigitalOcean.

Timeline
Week 1-2: Set up Next.js frontend and Django backend.

Week 3-4: Implement user authentication and survey functionality.

Week 5: Integrate Stripe for payments.

Week 6: Test and deploy the application.
